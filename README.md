# Tower of Dreams

Fight waves of enemies and defeat floor bosses to make it to the top of the tower! The one that makes it to the top will have their greatest desire fulfilled! But how can someone become strong enough to make it to the top? By learning japanese! Each enemy, obstacle, and floor tests your japanese vocab and grammar to make sure you are strong enough to move forward!

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implenmented with the following technologies:

* JavaScript

* HTML5

* CSS3

* Canvas API

* Webpack

* NPM

## Implementation Timeline

* Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. Create Title page and some main game classes. Get some components rendered on the screen.

* Monday: Dedicate this day toward implementing the underlying logic of Conway's Game of Life. Ensure that I can ask questions, a user can answer questions, and that responses are saved. If time, make sure this is all rendered correctly on the canvas.

* Tuesday: If I didn't get to it already, make sure the UI for questions is rendered correctly. Make sure they rerender correctly when I advance the question changes. Render the avatar and enemy animation.

* Wednesday: Focus on styling. If time, add a money system. 

* Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

## About

### General

Tower of Dreams was built on HTML5 canvas and uses spaced repition and rewards to help you learn japanese. It features amazing pixel animations and is a fully-featured game, with different enemies and bosses, a study section, a testing section, and progress saving. 

### Learning

At "Home", your avatar can "Train". This lets you learn new vocab and grammar before taking on the next floor of the dungeon. 

### Testing

Once you have trained enough at home, you can try to take on the next floor in the tower. This will test all of the vocab and grammar you have learned with penatlies if you get a questions wrong. Answer too many incorrectly, and you have to go back home and recover (study) before you can try again.

### Loot

Earn trophies to display in your house!

## Future Plans

### Money

Gain money after defeating each enemy! 

### Shop

Visit the shop to buy potions and equipment that will give you different advantages inside the dungeon!

### Friends

Add friends to keep track of each other's progress and show off your favorite loot!
