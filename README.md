## About

### General

Tower of Dreams was built on HTML5 canvas and uses spaced repition and rewards to help you learn japanese. It features amazing pixel animations and is a fully-featured game, with different enemies and bosses, a study section, a testing section, and progress saving. 

### Learning

At "Home", your avatar can "Train". This lets you learn new vocab and grammar before taking on the next floor of the dungeon. 

### Testing

Once you have trained enough at home, you can try to take on the next floor in the tower. This will test all of the vocab and grammar you have learned with penatlies if you get a questions wrong. Answer too many incorrectly, and you have to go back home and recover (study) before you can try again.

### Loot

From defeating enemies and floor bosses, you will earn money and special items. 

### Shop

Visit the shop to buy potions and equipment that will give you different advantages inside the dungeon!

Add friends to keep track of each other's progress and show off your favorite loot!
